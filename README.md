# $^{135}$Pr - Energy Ellipsoid and Energy Surface

Study of the energy surface for the $^{135}$Pr isotope using a semi-classical approximation for the energy function H'.

The energy surface is graphically represented, together with the triaxial potential and the *energy ellipsoid* given by the 3-dimensional representation of the nucleus in the total angular momentum space.

## Project goal

[ ] - Create *Contour Plots*  for the three cases of quantization:

* Short axis quantization
* Long axis quantization
* Intermediate axis quantization

[ ] - Compute the inertial factor $A$ for every situation of inertial moments ordering.

[ ] - Plot the *triaxial potential* $V(q)$ for  the required inertial parameters and the elliptical coordinate $q$.

[ ] - Compute and represent the 3D surface of the nucleus's energy, taking into consideration the values of the moments of inertia and the *coupling angle* $\theta$.

## Revised work

### July 2020 - JPG preparation

For [Journal of Physics G](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0954-3899), a revised and overall **improved** version of the paper must be submitted.

The tasks required for improving the results are related to the inertial parameter. One must redo the contour plots with new parameters.
